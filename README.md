# Slang
A small and flexible front-end for GLSL-like languages.

## Project goal
Provide a simple GLSL-like shading language front-end, that is : a lexer, a parser, and a semantic analyser.
The system should be simple and lightweight, and well documented. A thorough test suite should also be included.

## Status
Currently only the parser is implemented. Most of the GLSL 4.0 specification is supported. The test suite is on its way.

## License
The code is distributed under the LGPL license.
